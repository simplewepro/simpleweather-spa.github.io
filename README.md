# Hello there!

So this Single Page Application can give you short information about weather in any city! <br>
Weather data is provided by http://openweathermap.org/

# Getting started

In first you need to have Node.js installed. If not - visit [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). <br>
Then you need an http-server.

Just use <br>
`npm install -g http-server` <br>
and run it in root path <br>
`http-server`

# Future fixlist

In next few days.

>- Redevelop search bar, add livesearch with select-type dropdown list. <br>
>- Fix an error, occurring when you add city, that does not exist in citylist of openweather.
